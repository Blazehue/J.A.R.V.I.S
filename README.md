## Configuration

Edit `config/config.json` to customize:

- **Voice Settings**: Recognition engine, TTS voice, wake word
- **Behavior**: Confirmation prompts, auto-save locations
- **Appearance**: GUI theme, system tray behavior
- **Shortcuts**: Custom keyboard shortcuts
- **Personality**: Response style, formality level

## Development

### Adding New Commands

1. Add intent pattern in `core/intent_recognizer.py`
2. Implement command handler in appropriate module
3. Add response templates in `personality/templates.py`
4. Update command processor in `core/command_processor.py`

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with debug logging
python main.py --debug
```

## Troubleshooting

### Voice recognition not working
- Check microphone permissions in Windows settings
- Ensure microphone is set as default recording device
- Test with `python -m speech_recognition` in terminal

### Applications not launching
- Verify application is installed
- Check if application path is in system PATH
- Try running with administrator privileges

### High CPU usage
- Adjust voice recognition sensitivity in config
- Disable continuous listening mode
- Reduce screenshot quality settings
